**Repository Name: handwritte-text-detector**

### Overview
This repository contains the source code for a web application built with Flask for performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on uploaded images. The application utilizes PyTorch Lightning and the Transformers library for deep learning-based OCR tasks.

### Features
- Upload images in various formats (png, jpg, jpeg, gif) for OCR processing.
- Real-time OCR processing of uploaded images.
- Display of extracted text from uploaded images.
- Error handling for invalid file formats and missing files.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OCR-Web-App.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd OCR-Web-App
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
2. Access the application via a web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Upload an image file using the provided form.
4. Click the "Upload" button to initiate OCR processing.
5. View the extracted text displayed on the webpage.
